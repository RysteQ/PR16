# PR16

PR16 is an emulator for a non existent CPU, my target goals for this emulator is a 6502 like assembly and for it to act like a gameboy if that makes sense.

The following specs are the goals of this emulator:
1) 64 kilobytes of RAM
2) A 160x160 screen size
3) 1Mhz speed at most (1 million cycles)

The pixel size will be adjustable, from one pixel on the screen per pixel for the emulator all the way up to 8x8 pixels, of course you will be able to adjust those values via a header file.

This ReadMe file will be expanded in the near future.
